## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security and privacy very seriously at Probonex.  
If you discover a vulnerability or security issue, please report it **privately** using **GitHub’s Security Advisory system**:

1. Go to the repository’s **“Security”** tab on GitHub.
2. Click **“Report a vulnerability.”**
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

### What to Expect
- You will receive an acknowledgment within **5 business days**.
- We will investigate and, if confirmed, issue a patch as soon as possible.
- Once resolved, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability with credit to the reporter (if desired).

Please **do not open public issues** for security-related matters.  
This helps protect users while a fix is being developed.
